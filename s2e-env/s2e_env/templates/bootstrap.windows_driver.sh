# Notes:
#   - This function does not do anything else. It is up to you to customize it.
#     You can, e.g., call a program that makes use of the driver.
#   - You may also need to customize the driver installation in case the default
#     installer does not work with your driver, or if your driver comes with
#     a special installer.
